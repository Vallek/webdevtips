This selector will match all elements and pseudo-elements. Attention! Never use such selectors in real projects unless you are sure that this is a valid exception (for box-sizing, for example).
```
*,
*::before,
*::after {

}
```
```
outline: 1px solid limegreen !important;
```
```
background-color: rgba(0, 100, 0, 0.1) !important;
```
