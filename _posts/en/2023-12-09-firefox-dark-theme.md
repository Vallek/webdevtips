If you have problems with dark/light themes in Firefox. Browser not following system setting or you don't want it to follow theme (Firefox does it since 95) or you have problems with custom dark theme and so on.

1. Go to about:config
2. Find ``layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override``
3. Dark (0), light (1), system (2) or browser (3).
